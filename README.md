## Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator project made using JavaScript and CSS. It provides a web-based interface that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

The calculator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a layout that resembles a traditional calculator. It features a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for use on desktop and mobile devices.

The JavaScript code behind the calculator handles user input, performs the necessary calculations, and displays the results on the screen. It includes error handling to prevent common mistakes such as division by zero and invalid input.

The CSS styling of the calculator provides a modern and sleek appearance, with colors and typography that are easy on the eyes. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy for other developers to understand and modify if needed.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to improve their front-end development skills using JavaScript and CSS. You can clone the repository, modify the code to suit your needs, and use it as a starting point for your own calculator or similar projects.
